This analysis was thoroughly carried out to show the cases of malaria in Africa and its impact between the year 2007-2017.

Data Source: Kaggle.com

Tool: Power BI

Observation: 

From the malaria report analysis, below are the list of my observations

Congo, Dem Republic had the highest case of malaria infestation in Africa with a total case 
sum of 17M, Table 1.1 shows the top countries with malaria cases in Africa
Country Number of Malaria Cases
Congo, Dem Republic 17M
Nigeria 12M
Uganda 12M
Burkina Faso 10M
Mozambique 10M
Burundi 9M
The total number of Malaria cases for the year 2007 to 2017 is 588M
 Incidence of malaria per 1000 population of children taking anti-malaria drugs is 3.685k 
(3.4%)
 There was over a hundred million cases of malaria from the year 2016 to 2017 but in the 
early 2000â€™s the number of cases where not so high
Ghana has the highest percentage for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in 
pregnant women with 60%. Other countries are listed below

COUNTRY TOP COUNTRIES FOR PREVENTIVE 


TREATMENT IN PREGNANT WOMEN
Ghana 60%
Zambia 52%
Gambia 43%
Togo 42%

Methods and Tools

1 Data Source: Dashboard showing malaria data for 2007, including maps and interactive 
visualizations.

2 Analysis Tools: Geographic mapping, bar and pie charts, and a dynamic incidence gauge 
were employed for insights.

Summary of Findings:

Malaria is a common disease in Africa. The disease is transmitted to humans through infected 
mosquito bites. Although you can take preventive measures against malaria, it can be lifethreatening. This dataset includes the malaria cases in African countries, he incidence at risk 
and the data on preventive treatments against malaria.

Content:
This dataset includes data on all African countries from the year 2007 to 2017. Each country 
has a unique ISO-3 country code and the dataset includes the latitude and longitude point of 
each country as well. The dataset includes the cases of malaria that have been reported in each 
country and each year as well as data on preventive measures that have been taken o prevent 
malaria.

Recommendations

Invest in Data-Driven Interventions:

a. Build capacity for better data collection and monitoring of malaria cases, 
insecticide usage, and access to healthcare services.

b. Use predictive analytics to identify trends and allocate resources effectively.

Improve Access to Basic Water and Sanitation Services:

a. Enhance infrastructure for basic drinking water and sanitation services, especially 
in malaria-prone regions.

b. Prioritize funding and support for initiatives aimed at improving hygiene to reduce 
breeding grounds for malaria vectors.

Expand Antimalarial Drug Distribution:

a. Strengthen distribution networks to ensure greater coverage among vulnerable 
populations, particularly children in urban and rural areas.

b. Implement educational campaigns to promote drug compliance and awareness of 
preventive measures.

 Scale-Up Insecticide Usage:
 
a. Focus on areas with high malaria incidence, particularly in Uganda and Togo, 
where reported cases are the highest.

b. Conduct further studies to determine the effectiveness of current insecticide 
programs and optimize deployment strategies to address observed fluctuations in 
case reduction.

 Community Engagement and Education:
 
a. Conduct localized awareness campaigns to educate communities on malaria 
prevention methods, such as using insecticide-treated bed nets.

b. Engage local leaders to promote the adoption of basic hygiene practices and access 
to healthcare facilities
